## OpenCV-Python

Python is a general purpose programming language started by Guido van Rossum, which became very popular in short time mainly because of its simplicity and code readability. It enables the programmer to express his ideas in fewer lines of code without reducing any readability.

Compared to other languages like C/C++, Python is slower. But another important feature of Python is that it can be easily extended with C/C++. This feature helps us to write computationally intensive codes in C/C++ and create a Python wrapper for it so that we can use these wrappers as Python modules. This gives us two advantages: first, our code is as fast as original C/C++ code (since it is the actual C++ code working in background) and second, it is very easy to code in Python. This is how OpenCV-Python works, it is a Python wrapper around original C++ implementation.

## OpenCV-Python Tutorials

OpenCV introduces a new set of tutorials which will guide you through various functions available in OpenCV-Python. This guide is mainly focused on OpenCV 3.x version (although most of the tutorials will work with OpenCV 2.x also).

A prior knowledge on Python and Numpy is required before starting because they wonâ€™t be covered in this guide. Especially, a good knowledge on Numpy is must to write optimized codes in OpenCV-Python.
